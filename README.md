### Description

Implemented **ACF Flexible Content** to build modular and reusable content blocks. This setup allows editors to:

- Add new sections
- Reorder existing blocks
- Remove content without touching code

The content blocks are integrated into a custom page template and can be reused across multiple pages, making content management more efficient and consistent.
